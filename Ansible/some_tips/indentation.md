📝 Proper Indentation in YAML Files

🔑 YAML requires spaces, not tabs. Using tabs can lead to formatting issues.

🔢 Use the same number of spaces for each level of indentation. Common choices are 2 spaces or 4 spaces.

🌟 Each level of indentation represents a nested block of data. For example, task lists should be indented under the "tasks" key.

🔄 Maintain consistent indentation for key-value pairs. The colon (:) should be followed by a space.

📋 Use a hyphen (-) followed by a space for items in lists. Ensure that each item has the same level of indentation.

📦 Increase the indentation level for nested blocks. For example, tasks are nested under the "tasks" key.

📐 Keep items aligned vertically to enhance readability.

Remember: 🧐 Proper indentation ensures your YAML files are structured correctly and easily readable.
