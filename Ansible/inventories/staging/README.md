Create a README file in the `staging/` directory to provide information about the purpose of this directory and how it's used.

# Staging Inventory

This directory contains the inventory information for the staging environment. It includes the following files and directories:

- `hosts`: This file defines the inventory of hosts and groups for the staging environment.
- `group_vars/`: This directory contains YAML files with group-specific variables used in playbooks and roles targeting the staging environment.

Modify the `hosts` file to include your staging server information and organize hosts into groups. You can also define group-specific variables in the `group_vars/` directory to customize behavior for different host groups.

For example playbooks and roles, refer to this inventory using the `-i` flag:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/staging/hosts playbook.yml
